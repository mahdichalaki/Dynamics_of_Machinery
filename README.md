The project's main objectives are:

1. **Modeling the Mechanism:**
   - Consider a four-bar linkage mechanism (link 4 moving as a crank-rocker mechanism).
   - Define the appropriate dimensions and initial angles.

2. **Velocity and Acceleration Analysis:**
   - Using vector loop equations to determine angular velocities and accelerations.
   - Set angular velocity of link 1 to a constant value.

3. **Motion Simulation:**
   - Develop an animation in MATLAB to visualize the movement of the mechanism.
   - Ensure step-wise motion updates for accurate visualization.

4. **Point Analysis:**
   - Calculate absolute velocities and accelerations of key points (e.g., B, F5, F6, C).
   - Plot velocity and acceleration diagrams.

5. **Force Analysis:**
   - Calculate the forces acting on joints considering linear density.
   - Assume the mass of the slider to be 1 kg.

6. **Comparison with Commercial Software:**
   - Simulate the same mechanism in **ADAMS** or **SAM** software.
   - Compare the results and analyze discrepancies.
